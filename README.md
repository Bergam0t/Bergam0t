### Hi there - I'm Sammi! üöµ üè∏ üé∑ üë©‚Äçüíª

I'm currently a trainer on the [Health Services Modelling Associates Programme](https://sites.google.com/nihr.ac.uk/hsma)

I was previously a data analyst, and later data scientist, in the NHS. 

I completed my BSc in Biological Sciences at the University of Oxford in 2011-14, and my MSc in Health Data Science at the University of Exeter in 2020-21, with a focus on web app development for healthcare service improvement.

I'm currently working on
- animated outputs for discrete event simulation event logs
- user-friendly visualisation of large graph networks in Streamlit
- open-source teaching materials on geographical visualisation, location allocation problems, gradient boosting methods, explainable AI, web app development with Streamlit, reproducible outputs with Quarto, forecasting, process mining with pm4py, and more...   

My current favourite things to work with are
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (particularly serverless deployment with the amazing [stlite](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite) package)
- [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/)
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) and [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/)

I'd love to chat about
- how to use routinely collected data better to improve mental healthcare services
- how to make it easier for analysts and data scientists to securely deploy custom web apps in their organisations
- improving data literacy in the NHS and helping stakeholders understand the amazing potential of R, Python, advanced analytics, operational research and data science 

Here are a couple of the things I've created:

## Animated event logs for discrete event simulation

Play around with a live demo of this [here](https://github.com/hsma-programme/Teaching_DES_Concepts_Streamlit) - note that it won't load in Firefox!
